Iâ€™m a lifelong learner. I love learning and working with people and never stop trying. From recent projects during many courses in the university such as Software Engineering, Database system , Animation , OOP , and Web Programming, I worked with different group of people all along ,
though I'm aware about making mistakes, it is important to have courage to be a changer or admit what i donâ€™t know, ask questions, foster the team to grow and finish the job together.
Iâ€™m a very team player type of person. Different perspective and opinions are excitments to me which help me adapt faster, understand better in the view that I may not experience like others.
I believe in myself to be able to learn and grow up as an original, and real one.
